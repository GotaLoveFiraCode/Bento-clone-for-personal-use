# Bento Clone for personal use
a
This is a [Bento](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento) clone that only exists for personal use. I have no idea what the legal situation is, but I have to publish this repository to use github pages, so yeah.
Feel free to do what ever you want with this, but I will not take any responsibility for what you do. Also many thanks to [Migueravila](https://github.com/migueravila) for making this project! The binary clock I used is from [this](https://github.com/pilotpirxie/binary-clock), many thanks to [pilotpirxie](https://github.com/pilotpirxie) too.
